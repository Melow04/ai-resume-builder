# Skills Section Update Summary

## ✅ What Changed

The Skills section has been completely redesigned to be **universal and industry-agnostic**. It now works for ALL professions, not just programming!

- ❌ Categories were hardcoded (Programming Languages, Frameworks, etc.)
- ❌ Couldn't handle spaces or commas properly
- ❌ Limited to simple list format

### After (New System):
- ✅ Works for ANY profession (Marketing, Healthcare, Finance, Sales, Education, etc.)
- ✅ AI automatically detects your industry
- ✅ Creates appropriate categories for your field
- ✅ Natural language input - type however you want
- ✅ Smart formatting with proficiency levels
- ✅ Fully ATS-optimized

## 📝 How to Use

• "I know Excel, financial modeling, and data analysis"
• "I have experience with JavaScript, Python, and web development"
```

### Step 2: Click "Generate ATS Skills with AI"
The AI will:
