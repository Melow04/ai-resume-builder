## Resuvmint — AI Resume Builder (Mint Theme)

Resuvmint helps you craft professional, tailored resumes with AI — private by default, stored locally in your browser. Built with Next.js and styled with a mint gradient theme (#3ECF8E → #1F6948).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see Resuvmint.

You can start editing the hero by modifying `app/page.tsx` and global styles in `app/globals.css`.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
